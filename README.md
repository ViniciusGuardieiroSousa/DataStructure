# Data structures: English, [Portugues](https://github.com/ViniciusGuardieiroSousa/DataStructure/blob/main/README-pt.md)
This is a repository for data structures and algorithms study

# Concepts:

## Algorithms:
An algorithm is a combination of well-defined, finite and unambiguous steps that are applied  over an input dataset to result in an output dataset.

This algorithm will be **correct** when, whenever we run the algorithm for the same inputa dataset, we will have the same output dataset.


## Data Structure:

Data structure is a way to storing and organizing data in memory.
